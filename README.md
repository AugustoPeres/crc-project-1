# crc-project-1

_The Marvel Universe has a huge number of super heroes who appear in even more comic books.In this project we choose a network that is represented by a bipartite graph, whose nodes are dividedinto two groups: the first group has a total of 6486 nodes (the heroes) and the second one has 12942nodes (the books). However, for reasons we will explain later, this network is not good for the studyof some properties we talked about in the lectures and therefore we will create a graph with onlythe nodes that represent the heroes and will link two nodes if the two heroes appear in the samebook. This will allow us to get more curious conclusions about the Marvel Universe._
